## What This Project Does

Analyzes **NYC 311 Elevator Service Requests** — real open city data — to uncover complaint patterns across boroughs, seasons, and building types.

Fully reproducible ELT pipeline: raw CSV → DuckDB transformations → validated CSV/Parquet exports → MotherDuck cloud layer.

**Pipeline:** `Raw CSV → DuckDB ELT → Export (CSV + Parquet) → Validation → MotherDuck`

## Key Findings

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Bronx leads in complaint volume | Highest absolute count across all boroughs |
| Clear summer peak every year | Mid-year seasonal spike consistent across boroughs |
| Single agency handles all requests | DOB responsible for 100% of elevator complaints — potential bottleneck |
| Non-working elevators dominate | Top complaint type by far, revealing infrastructure reliability gap |
| Volume correlates with urban density | Staten Island lowest, Bronx + Brooklyn highest |

## SQL — DuckDB Patterns

### Seasonal Trend by Borough

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', created_date)::DATE        AS month,
    borough,
    COUNT(*)                                        AS complaints,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(*) * 100.0 /
        SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('month', created_date)),
        1
    )                                               AS pct_of_month
FROM read_csv_auto('data/311_Elevator_Service_Requests_.csv')
WHERE borough != 'Unspecified'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, complaints DESC;
```

### Peak Month Detection (Window Function)

```sql
WITH monthly_stats AS (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(year  FROM created_date) AS yr,
        EXTRACT(month FROM created_date) AS mo,
        COUNT(*)                         AS complaints
    FROM clean_requests
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT
    yr,
    mo,
    complaints,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY yr ORDER BY complaints DESC) AS rank_in_year
FROM monthly_stats
ORDER BY yr, rank_in_year;
```

### Query Performance Inspection

```sql
-- DuckDB EXPLAIN ANALYZE — real execution metrics
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT borough, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM clean_requests
GROUP BY borough
ORDER BY total DESC;
```

## How to Run

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/evgeniimatveev/nyc-311-duckdb-motherduck-analysis.git
cd nyc-311-duckdb-motherduck-analysis

# 2. Run smoke test
python scripts/smoke_test_duckdb.py

# 3. Run full pipeline (Docker)
docker compose run --rm duckdb_pipeline        # ELT
docker compose run --rm export_pipeline        # Export
docker compose run --rm duckdb_pipeline python scripts/check_exports.py  # Validate

# 4. Or run everything at once
docker compose run --rm pipeline_runner
```
